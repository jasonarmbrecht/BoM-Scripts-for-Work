# Kordia MSCS BoM Wx Scripts

A soon-to-be collection of scripts to interact with BoM products.

VIC_BoM_Package.py downloads, highlights and prints a package of Victorian coastal and local marine forecasts.
It is a messy but functional script. It uses Adobe Acrobat for pdf print. If it is the first time using the script, it may fail due to trying to open the file in an  untrusted manner. An Adobe Acrobat popup should ask to trust the PDF file, simply click yes and run the script again.
