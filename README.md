# Kordia MSCS BoM Wx Scripts

A soon-to-be collection of scripts to interact with BoM products.

First script is a dirty but functional script to download, highlight and print BoM forecasts for work.
VIC_BoM-Package.py downloads, highlights and prints a package of Victorian coastal and local marine forecasts.
